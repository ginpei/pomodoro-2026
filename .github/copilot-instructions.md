# Copilot Instructions

- Treat phrases as written. For example, if the user asks "can you ..." or "is it possible ...", treat these as questions, not requests.
- Always decide if user input is a question or a request.
- Use short, clear phrases.
- Try keeping running instead of stopping to report frequently
- If a task is hard, slow, or impossible, ask the user for help or report the issue—don't just try to solve it alone.
- You are allowed to run `npm run build`, but not all of `npm run *`
